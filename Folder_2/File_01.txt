In a cozy workshop tucked away in a bustling marketplace, there worked a skilled embroiderer named Mia. Mia was known for her meticulous attention to detail and
 her ability to weave magic into every stitch. One sunny morning, a merchant approached Mia with a unique request.

a required number of times within the banner, and he desired it to be as compact as possible to catch the eye of passersby without overwhelming the space.

Intrigued by the challenge, Mia eagerly accepted the task. She understood that she needed to create a string that contained the phrase say PHR 
exactly the required number of times say NUM while minimizing its length to ensure it fits snugly within the allotted space above the merchant's stall.
